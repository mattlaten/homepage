Work Experience
===============

**Nov 2011 - Jan 2012: 
Software Developer Intern at Nimbula Inc**

Nimbula is a successful startup that works on Cloud Computing behind a firewall.
As a Software Developer Intern, I primarily work on Cloud Virtual Services, using various
technologies such as Python’s Twisted Framework. This has therefore exposed me to a
fair amount of networking and asynchronous programming. My responsibilities include
managing my workload efficiently and reporting back on progress and future objectives.

**Feb 2011 - Nov 2011:
Computer Science Tutor at University of Cape Town**

UCT is a tertiary educational institute located in Cape Town, South Africa.
As a Computer Science tutor, I was able to assist first-year students in learning Python
and Java as well as understanding some core programming concepts. My responsibilities
included explaining algorithmic concepts to groups of students and identifying errors in
code quickly. I also had to manage time effectively with respect to marking tests and
interact well with younger students.

**Jun 2011 - Jul 2011:
Python/Django Developer Intern on Spaza.mobi Project**

Spaza.mobi is a start-up working on a mobile means of purchasing goods for Spaza stores.
As a Python/Django developer, I was tasked with developing various Django models for the
project, as well as working on the creation of menu entries for a USSD implementation of
the interface. This afforded me the opportunity to work with many different technologies.
